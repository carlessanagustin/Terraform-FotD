# Terraform-FotD
Terraform Function of the Day
As a frequent user of Terraform, I've found that the documentation is good, but I feel that it could do a better job of explaining how to use the various functions included in the interpolation engine. 

In a series of [posts][1] I am going to document a different Terraform function each day and how you might use it. This won't require using a provider per se. I'm just going to use variables, the null resource, and outputs to work through these functions. 

During the course of these posts I am also going to include the examples on this GitHub repo, so you can pull the code whenever you want.
